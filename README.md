## Description

The project is a multipurpose project that is made to ease the work of both instructor and students, a one stop project to create a quiz , attempt the quiz exam and even display the result along with the histogram and the response sheet of each student

Instructor: Our project allows the instructor to create a quiz either from the predefined database of questions of courses IB(Introduction to Bio-engineering ) , IC(Introduction to Computer Science) , IE(Introduction to Electrical Engineering) and Mathematics (Semester-1 courses) or create a custom quiz by inputting the questions along with their answers. It is a convenient way for instructors to conduct quizzes.

Student: Our project allows the students to attempt the quiz exam created by the instructor and also analyze the result of the quiz given . It will also have the option of displaying the performance of the students who gave the same quiz by displaying the histogram.
